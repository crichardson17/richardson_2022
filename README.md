Photoionization model grids from Richardson et al. 2022

#######################################################

This respository contains the output for all the models in Richardson+ 2022:

Please email crichardson17 at elon.edu for additional model output or to request
models for different values of certain parameters (e.g. black hole mass, density)

The directory structure is organized to track changes in the parameter space.
Two files are contained at the end of each path, which contain the emission
line predictions scaled to Hb for a given mixing methodology, AGN fraction,
Z, and U. One file contains the intrinsic line intensities and one file 
contains the emergent line intensities. The definitions for each of predictions 
are extensively covered the Cloudy (nublado.org) documentation Hazy 1 and 
Hazy 2. Please consult those references if you are unclear about which 
intensities to use.
